# Weather Information web part

This web part provides you the ability to display basic weather information for one location on a web page. The web part depends on a service provided by [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/current/). The API requires authentication, and for that reason it is necessary to register for free plan to be able to obtain API Key that will be used to authenticate the calls. API Key has to be entered in web part configuration.
